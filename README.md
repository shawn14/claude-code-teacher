## Interactive Chat Mode

The new interactive chat mode lets you have real-time conversations with your AI teacher while monitoring code changes:

```

📁 Recent File Changes:
  📝 Modified: auth-service.js 2:45:32 PM
  ✅ Created: auth-service.test.js 2:46:15 PM

💬 Chat:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You (2:46:20 PM): What changed in the auth service?

Teacher: The last change was in auth-service.js:

Here's what changed:
```diff
@@ -15,6 +15,8 @@
       const existingUser = await this.userRepository.findByEmail(userData.email);
       if (existingUser) {
         throw new ValidationError('User already exists');
       }
+      
+      // Add rate limiting check
+      await this.checkRateLimit(userData.email);
```

This change added rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. It's a security best practice!

You (2:46:45 PM): How does rate limiting work?

Teacher: Rate limiting is like a bouncer at a club - it controls how many requests someone can make in a given time period. Here's how it works:

1. Track requests per user/IP
2. Set a limit (e.g., 5 login attempts per minute)
3. Block or delay requests that exceed the limit
4. Reset the count after the time window

This prevents attackers from trying thousands of passwords quickly!

## Example Output

```
=================================================
📝 UPDATE #3 | 2:45:32 PM
=================================================

FILE: payment-handler.js (MODIFIED)

CODE SNIPPET:
```javascript
var stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_123456789'); // Hardcoded API key!

function processPayment(req, res) {
  var amount = req.body.amount;
  // Direct database query with user input
  db.query('INSERT INTO payments VALUES (' + amount + ', "' + cardNumber + '")',
```

EXPLANATION:
Payment processing handler with multiple critical security issues.

🧙 Senior Dev Suggestions:

🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES:
   • 🚨 HARDCODED API KEY DETECTED! This is a critical security vulnerability. Move to environment variables immediately!
     Fix: Use parameterized queries: db.query("INSERT INTO payments VALUES (?, ?)", [amount, cardNumber])
   • 🚨 CRITICAL: SQL INJECTION VULNERABILITY! User input is being concatenated directly into SQL!

⚠️  Important considerations:
   • Use const or let instead of var. Var has function scope which can lead to bugs.
   • This looks like callback hell. Consider using async/await for cleaner code.

💡 Suggestions:
   • Synchronous file operations block the event loop. Use async versions.

💪 "Good code is like a good joke - it needs no explanation"
```
