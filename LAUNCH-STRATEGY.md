1/ 🚀 vibe-code is LIVE!

After months of building, we're excited to share a tool that 
transforms how developers learn and grow.

One command to start: npx vibe-code

Here's what makes it special 🧵

2/ 🎯 The Problem

We've all been there:
• Shipping bugs we could've prevented
• Learning concepts AFTER making mistakes  
• Getting PR feedback when it's too late

What if you could learn WHILE coding?

3/ 💡 The Solution

vibe-code provides real-time insights as you type:
• Explains what your changes mean
• Warns about security issues
• Suggests performance improvements
• Teaches concepts in context

4/ 🎮 Three Powerful Modes

🔍 Diff Mode: See what changed and why it matters
📋 Rules Mode: Enforce team standards automatically
💬 Chat Mode: Ask questions, get answers instantly

Switch between them with Shift+Tab!

5/ 🧠 Smart Insights

**Hacker News Post**
```
Show HN: Vibe-Code – Real-time code insights that teach while you type

Hey HN! We built vibe-code to solve a problem we faced daily: 
learning from mistakes after they happen instead of preventing 
them in the first place.

vibe-code monitors your code changes in real-time and provides 
instant educational insights. It's like having a senior developer 
explain the "why" behind every suggestion.

Key features:
- Works with any editor (monitors file system, not plugin-based)
- Three modes: Diff (git insights), Rules (team standards), Chat (Q&A)
- Teaches concepts in context, not in isolation
- Zero config - just run npx vibe-code

Technical details:
- Built with Node.js for cross-platform compatibility
- Uses chokidar for file watching
- Integrates with git for diff analysis
- Local-first (no code sent to servers)

We'd love your feedback on:
- The onboarding experience
- Accuracy of insights
- Performance with large codebases
- Feature requests

Try it: npx vibe-code
Repo: https://github.com/shawn14/vibe-code
```
